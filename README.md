# tic-tac-toe

This is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript path. I am tasked with creating this game using objects, but I'm not fully certain I nailed it. I know that at least one of these should be anonymous (called immediately) but I can't remember how to do that, and I don't want to break it.
The logic for determining a winner isn't the most sophisticated, but it works. I definitely want to refactor it to loop through the indices of the board using an array of Winning Combos (the index positions at which X or O must be present for a win event), but that will happen at a later date.

Update 2/5/22

Added all functionality. I couldn't figure out how to avoid using global variables. I do see the point of anonymous functions that would be declared immediately, but I guess I need some help to figure out how to use those better and to avoid the globals.
